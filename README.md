demo website creation

#### What are we doing here?
<p> So we have need of a getting an app, service, whatever online and running for our group.  This playbook will let us leverage an already created role as well as additional tasks around making sure our firewall ports are open and our service was restarted. <p>
<p> To get started make sure that this repo has been downloaded.  Once downloaded verify the contents of the 'files' directory and look for the following:
- index.html
- package.json
- mithril.js
- css and img folders
  
If all is available use your favorite text editor and open up the create-website.yml file.  <p>
